# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Release artifact actions** — Beta release artifact upload/download steps use current GitHub action major versions to avoid Node 20 runtime deprecation warnings on future release runs.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-13

OpenPi v0.1.5 fixes the packaged-app file mention fallback path and hardens release automation so GitHub Releases always publish current changelog content.

### Fixed

- **File mention fallback after native fff import failure** — The fff host no longer imports `@ff-labs/fff-node` at module load time. If the native package fails to import in a packaged app, OpenPi now still loads the host module and uses filesystem fallback search instead of returning no file mention results.
- **GitHub release notes source** — The beta release workflow now extracts release bodies from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` version section, preventing stale `RELEASE_NOTES.md` content from being published to new GitHub Releases.
- **CI action runtime warnings** — CI and beta release workflows use current GitHub action major versions to avoid Node 20 deprecation warnings on GitHub-hosted runners.

### Changed

- **Release helper safeguards** — `scripts/release.mjs` now requires explicit release notes and refuses to generate placeholder-only changelog entries.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-13

OpenPi v0.1.4 hardens the file attachment picker, fixes workspace startup scoping, and documents stricter release-note requirements.

### Fixed

- **File mention picker reliability** — `@` file attachments now wait briefly for fff's cold-start scan and fall back to a bounded filesystem search if the native fff package is unavailable, quarantined, or temporarily returns no matches. This keeps queries like `@AG` finding `AGENTS.md` instead of showing a permanent "No files match" state.
- **Workspace startup scope** — startup restore and the workspace rail now use only workspaces explicitly opened in OpenPi. Historical Pi session directories discovered during indexing no longer pollute the rail or cause OpenPi to auto-restore the wrong workspace.
- **Ignore generated artifacts correctly** — `.gitignore` now uses standalone comments instead of inline comments after patterns, so generated `out/` and `release/` directories are actually ignored by Git.

### Changed

- **Release discipline** — Project rules now require every release to inspect commits since the previous tag and replace automation-generated placeholder changelog entries with concrete user-facing notes before tagging.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-13

OpenPi v0.1.3 improves update visibility, CI reliability, file attachments, Git/workspace synchronization, and beta documentation.

### Added

- **App self-update check** — OpenPi now checks GitHub Releases on cold start and exposes a sidebar update chip when a newer version is available. Unsigned beta builds open the release page in the browser instead of attempting an in-app auto-install.
- **What's New modal** — Added a sidebar changelog button that reads bundled `CHANGELOG.md` from app resources and renders release notes inside OpenPi.

### Fixed

- **Git panel workspace switching** — Git status polling and file-tree watching now restart on every `session_ready` event, so the persistent Git panel follows the active workspace instead of showing stale data from a previous workspace.
- **Initial `@` file picker failure** — Removed stale fff initialization tracking that could permanently return `[]` after a failed native `FileFinder.create()` attempt.
- **CI test environment** — Added a deterministic in-memory `localStorage` stub for Vitest and removed the undeclared optional `@testing-library/jest-dom` setup import, restoring clean `npm ci && npm test` behavior on GitHub Actions.
- **CI workflow compatibility** — Updated CI to use valid GitHub Actions versions, run verification with verbose test output, and compile on macOS, Linux, and Windows after verification passes.
- **Release version correction** — Deleted the accidental `v0.1.4` tag and restored the intended `v0.1.3` release line.

### Changed

- **Public wording** — Removed misleading "native" wording from docs and product text; OpenPi is described accurately as an Electron desktop workbench.
- **Release packaging** — Bundled `CHANGELOG.md` via `electron-builder` `extraResources` so packaged apps can show release notes offline.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-13

OpenPi v0.1.2 enables Pi package extensions in sessions and makes package-loading failures non-fatal.

### Fixed

- **Pi packages can load session extensions** — Removed the `noExtensions: true` resource-loader setting so user-configured Pi packages such as `@heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-diff`, `@heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-pretty`, and `@heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-search` can register their tools and extensions in OpenPi sessions.
- **Non-fatal package reload failures** — Wrapped Pi resource-loader reload paths so one failing package no longer crashes session startup.


## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-13

# OpenPi v0.1.1

Patch release with two bug fixes since v0.1.0.

## Fixes

- **npm ENOENT on Finder/Dock launch** — OpenPi now enriches `PATH` from the user's login shell before starting the Pi SDK, so packages configured with Pi (npm-backed Skills, Prompts, or Extensions) resolve correctly whether the app is launched from a terminal or directly from macOS Finder/Dock. Previously launching from Finder/Dock would log `Failed to run npm root -g: spawnSync npm ENOENT`.
- **Customizations modal sidebar** — Removed the broken logo image from the brand block at the bottom of the Customizations nav rail; only the app name and version label are shown.

## What is OpenPi?

OpenPi is a desktop workbench for the [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). It wraps Pi's session tree, streaming conversation, extensions, skills, and customizations in an Electron + SolidJS UI.

OpenPi depends on `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` and intentionally does not reimplement Pi's session tree, compaction, queue semantics, tool execution, extensions, or provider behavior.

## Beta caveats

- macOS notarization and Windows code signing are not configured yet; expect OS trust warnings on downloaded installers.
- Permission gates, workspace trust hardening, and keychain-backed secrets are roadmap items before broad stable distribution.
- This beta is for early testers comfortable running local developer tools.


## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-13

Initial public beta for early testers.

- Added Electron + SolidJS desktop workbench for Pi sessions, workspace navigation, model selection, conversation streaming, and tool cards.
- Added OpenCode-style command palette (`Shift+Cmd+P`) for commands, files, and sessions.
- Added Customizations modal for Pi Extensions, Skills, Prompts, Themes, Packages, models, notifications, keybindings, updates, and app info.
- Added persistent Git/source-control panel with file tree, file search, diff viewer, and file viewer.
- Added bottom terminal/output panel backed by Electron main and `node-pty`.
- Added OpenPi app branding, runtime version metadata, icon packaging, CI, and tag-triggered beta builds.
