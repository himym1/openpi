| Goal | `/goal pause` pauses active goal | implemented | Status transition `active→paused` | |
| Goal | `/goal resume` resumes paused goal | implemented | Status transition `paused→active` | |
| Goal | `/goal clear` marks complete | implemented | Status transition → `complete` | |
| Goal | `/goal budget N` sets token budget | implemented | Auto `budget_limited` when exceeded | |
| Goal | `get_goal` LLM tool returns goal status | implemented | `registerTool('get_goal')` | |
| Goal | `create_goal` LLM tool creates goal | implemented | `registerTool('create_goal')`, fails if exists | |
